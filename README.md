# GameOfLife

#Game uses a start file named as 'life.txt' where the symbol '*' is used to represent a
#living cell while the symbol '-' is used to symbolize a dead cell. In the game, if a living
#cell is surrounded by 2-3 other living cells, it survives to the next generation otherwise
#it dies. If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly 3 other living cells it lives in the next
#generation. The game displays the initial generation as well as 10 further generations.
